# Sound Money & Robust Programmability


Infinite scalablilty for financial inclusion With native smart contracts and robust architecture, XGT supports up to 3,000 transactions per second and a financially-inclusive experience for all users.

Dockerized libraries for egalitarian opportunity to run full nodes: An XGT daemon can be easily run with the provided Docker images, which enables exchanges, developers and applications to integrate and run XGT with unparalled efficiency, while also embracing reliability as a key security measure. Deploying and maintaining an XGT node is simple enough that anyone can do it.

Optimal governance for egalitarian participation: XGT will be supported by an unlimited number of nodes run by developers, applications, users and miners. Miners produce the blocks that track all XGT transactions at a rate of one block every three seconds and there is no limit on the number of miners. Together these nodes provide growing decentralization and security to XGT.

Streamlined full nodes for perfect app integration: The advantage of XGT nodes is that they are extremely quick to set up, inexpensive to operate or migrate to, and highly responsive relative to other networks. Better still, the open nature of the network means that it is available to all, and participants are not subject to the behaviour of a group of insiders. Anyone can operate a full node, or mine using the open source software. XGT is built with the knowledge that the benefit of a full node designed specifically for economic purposes, knowing full well non-economic data needs to be supported by off-chain, application-based APIs for optimal performance.

## Advantages

* Fast application and exchange integration: New streamlined blockchain infrastructure based on years of research.
* Real-time financial inclusion: Three-second block times.
* Decentralization: Proof of Work for network security, coin supply, and open governance.
* Revolutionary application development: Off-chain content and on-chain reference-IDs for rewarding community engagement
* Unlimited financial inclusion:
* On-chain currency creation with vote-able emissions for community growth via XGT Token Trees
* Unparalled bridging of applications and blockchain: base58 randomized wallet IDs for privacy and integration with off-chain account systems. Generated with a BTC compliant algorithm, and namespaced with XGT for user-safety

## Technical Details

* Currency symbol XGT
* Energy System, used to power SmartContracts without coin burn
* Proof of Work consensus
* ~18,700,000 XGT for egalitarian distribution, 21,000,000 token supply schedule.
* Mining halvings, targetted for sync with BTC supply halvings

## Announcement 

XGT was formally announced on [BitcoinTalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5340639.newmail) on May 28, 2021, at 06:56 PM PST.

# Installation

Getting started with XGT is fairly simple. You can either choose to use docker-images, build with docker manually or build from source directly. All steps have been documented and while many different OS are supported, the easiest one is Ubuntu 20.04.

## Quickstart

Just want to get up and running quickly? We have pre-built Docker images for your convenience. More details are in our [Mining XGT](https://github.com/xgt-network/xgt/wiki/Mining-XGT) Guide.

## Building

We **strongly** recommend using one of our pre-built Docker images or using Docker to build XGT. Both of these processes are described in the [Mining XGT](https://github.com/xgt-network/xgt/wiki/Mining-XGT).

To build from source, we also have [build instructions](https://github.com/xgt-network/xgt/wiki/Compiling-XGT) for Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) and macOS.

## Dockerized Mining

See [Mining XGT](https://github.com/xgt-network/xgt/wiki/Mining-XGT)

## CLI Wallet

We provide a basic cli wallet for interfacing with `xgtd`. The wallet is self-documented via command line help. See [xgt-ruby](https://github.com/xgt-network/xgt-ruby)

## System Requirements

4GB memory (16GB recommended)
x86 or AMD64 compatible CPU
